== Cinematic Journey ==

I have recently renewed my interest in cinema. As such I am going through the
Criterion collection and watching Mark Cousins’ _The Story of Film: An Odyssey_,
as well as a number of alternative sources for cinematic history.

As such, I am watching a lot of movies. The best way to absorb them is to write
about them. Thus, this repo.

I am chiefly interested in cinema’s symbolic and literary dimensions. After
that, I will comment on cinematography, directing style, characterization,
dialogue, and all the other features that go into a film. Truth be told, I am
absolutely _not_ reviewing these films. I am simply writing about them.

The file `journal.md` is just that, a cinematic journal. Each review is a new
markdown file beginning with the date in `YYYYMMDD_<title>.md` format. I will
use English titles with underscore spaces for the filenames and the original
language’s titles for the title within the file, as well as a translation (for
reference, especially in cases where the original title is in Cyrillic or
Japanese). The journal is a hodgepodge.

== Update 20200605 ==

This project has more or less fallen off. I cancelled my Criterion Channel
subscription because I haven't been using and and I wanted to save some money. I
haven't been watching many films, despite speaking French now (the primary
purpose of learning being to watch French art films) but hopefully I will
eventually get back to it.

I would also like to alphebetize this, despite it being ordered by date
viewed/written. I used a command to write in the filenames to write the links,
which is why they are ordered by date (the filenames begin with a date).
