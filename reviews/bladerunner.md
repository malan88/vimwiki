- The replicant 'Rachael' is given memories that prevent it from realizing that
  it is a replicant. How could this be feasible on a realistic level?  Would You
  would have to construct such an intricate set of memories that they lead up to
  the replicant's past. Or would you? It is frequently noted that humans create
  their own memories, effectively 'Filling in the blanks' which results in
  faulty memories and corrupted memories when reaccessed. It has lead to new
  forms of memory therapy. So theoretically they could plop a set of vague
  memories into the replicant, drop it into a situation, and it's mind would
  construct the memory glue to make it all make sense. Perhaps this is more
  realistic with a replicant than a human, as a replicant has a significantly
  less rich set of memories from which to draw, and so would not be as likely to
  rebel against the memory-vagueness or memory-gappiness.  
    - It seems the film addresses my point about vague memories. They implanted
      the memories of the Tyrell Corp President's niece. _That_ said, the only
      thing this addresses is how you can create a sufficiently rich set of
      memories. How do you glue the memories to the replicant's present? That is
      to say, the niece is not an assistant to Tyrell Corp's President. So do
      they stage the transition or does the human/replicant mind fill in the
      gaps?
- It's quite fascinating how BR pumps you full of philosophical ambivalence to
  idea of hunting replicants, making it obviously seem like a massive injustice,
  but at the same time making the hunted replicants seem very menacing, to say
  the least. Then, at the end, it becomes quite clear that the reason _those_
  particular replicants had to die was simply because they were evil. But can
  they accept their lot in life? Should they? Perhaps if they incorporated a bit
  more non-violence into the equation. Nonetheless, we root for Rachael's
  survival.
    - Speaking of Rachael, what is the deal with the Spanish dude and his
      origami, and how does the origami piece at the end fit into the whole
      running away thing? What's the point of it, I mean?
        - Read a bit about the themes in BR. Apparently the origami thing is an
          indicator of the possibility of Deckard being a replicant. The
          implanted memories of the unicorn dream indictate Graff might know
          Deckard's dreams. I think, to an extent, Graff sympathized with
          Deckard's love of Rachael and I thought he was warning him about her
          safety.
- I definitely thought for a second that Deckard might be a Replicant but I
  threw the idea out. I didn't see it through the lens of the unicorn day dream,
  though, but I didn't get that anyway. I noticed the angel motif on Zhora's
  death. And now that I see how much religious symbolism creeps in, I see the
  significance of Jared Leto's pronouncement that "The least you could do is
  announce that a child is born."
- The largest problem with the first film was the technological limitations.
  There is no way that in 2019 they didn't have cell phones but they had
  freaking flying fucking cars. The second film solves this problem. The
  technological motifs make a shit ton more sense.
- The second film is also superior in its mooding, in my opinion at least.
  Interestingly enough, Pan Am still exists in the film.
- Dennis Villaneuve is a fucking brilliant director, and this film is amazing.
  However, I am not sure that this film doesn't suffer from the prototypical
  predictable plotline. It is quite obvious from > 1:00:00 what the story is: he
  is a real born replicant, his memories are real and he was convinced that they
  were not, because Tyrell Corporation has been trying to reproduce the happy
  accident that is him. He was born of Harrison Ford and Rachel and she died in
  child birth. He had a twin sister. ((LOL. So wrong))
- I am confused by Ryan Gosling's comment that his hologram girl (I don't know
  her name) is 'very realistic.' Replicants _are_ AI. Therefore true AI is
  possible, and I do not see why the computer _isn't_ AI, and not just a
  realistic version of it. Perhaps the 'realistic' comment refers to how the
  hologram itself is realistic, and/or that the computer's emotions are
  realistic (this confuses me as well; we know replicant's have emotions--this
  is a very significant part of the film).
- Our memories are not contiguous. [[The 2049 filmmaker addresses my memory
  vagueness problem in the memorymaker's speech]]. We do not have one continuous
  memory that we ff, rw, or move around in. We have atomic memories with vaguely
  defined beginnings and ends, and even their order itself is--that is to say,
  the order of the atomic memories in time, and the order of the events within
  the memory, the phonemes of a memory--are not definite.
- How is it that we know replicants have emotions but the replicant test looks
  like an emotion test? What is the difference between a replicant's emotions
  and a human's emotions?
