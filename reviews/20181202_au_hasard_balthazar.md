Robert Bresson’s _Au Hasard Balthazar_
--------------------------------------

This is another movie, just like Ozu’s Tokyo Story, that I liked, that was
clearly quite good, that is laden with extremely rigorous technique and style,
but that I don’t have much to say about.

Bresson is rightly regarded as an auteur, but a peculiar one. He has a
fascinating obsession with telling the story through visuals rather than
emotional acting. It is most apparent in this film. Apparently, he referred to
his actors as “models” instead of actors. And there are scenes where their
apparent lack of emotion is striking.

This lack of emotion is very effective when it comes to Balthazar. Since animals
can’t emote very much, Balthazar benefits from Bresson’s approach to visual
storytelling. The animal seems as alive emotionally as the humans. Ironically,
Balthazar shows the _most_ emotion in the film, since he whinnys at one point,
if I recall correctly. He also eeyaw’s (if that’s the correct terminology).

I believe this film has a depth I didn’t actually plumb. The ending is quite sad
and shows clear symbolism. Will revisit in time.
