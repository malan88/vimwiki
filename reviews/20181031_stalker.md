Andrei Tarkovsky’s _Сталкер_
============================

The idea of that the left and right hemispheres of the brain correspond to our
rational and creative functions may perhaps be of more recent coinage than
Tarkkovsky’s film _Stalker_ (and are certainly of doubtful veracity), but the
idea of separating our creative and rational traits into different parts of our
personality is _not_ new, nor is it of doubtful veracity. And it is because of
this deep archetypal division of our personalities that I have a very hard time
not interpreting Stalker’s primary characters in this way: Writer is the
creative part of us, Professor is the rational part of us, and Stalker _is_ us.

For the better two thirds of this film I could not see the point of that
division. It is so obvious to me, and yet had next to nothing to do with the
dialogue and action on the screen. Sure I could nitpick the character’s
behaviors into their respective corners, but they were largely unstereotypical
of those divisions. _Then I came to the end_. And all became clear.

This film is first and foremost a film about _faith_. The room seems to
represent a quasi-Christian concept of grace, or faith itself. Stalker is
religious. This is actually made clear multiple times throught the film, from
his reciting a Catholic prayer during the lengthy (interminable!) scene where
the three rest in the zone, to the ending that made most of the film clear to
me. Neither Professor _nor_ Writer have any faith whatsoever, a point Stalker
makes clear in the final 20 minutes or so of the film. His final speech seems to
be Tarkovsky’s commentary on his contemporary Soviet society: it is a faithless
one, where neither the romantics nor the rationals have any kind of faith in
mystery whatsoever. It is a criticism of a materialistic Soviet society (ironic
that he might think the West would provide anything different!).

Nonetheless, the film does not neatly cleave into these meanings, and in fact
seems to yield a multitude of interpretations. My short review of _Solaris_ is
probably also flawed on this front. Tarkovsky is Jungian not in that he
consciously and directly inserts archetypal imagery into his film, but in that
he _feels_ through his film and himself in such a way that more complex and
layered archetypal imagery ends up in the film. As such it is a significantly
more complex work of art than if he had been consciously trying to build a
multi-layered and complex work. Unconscious art is always more complex and
interesting.

The scene on the threshhold of the room, for instance. Immediately after the
professor decides to disassemble the bomb (it must have been nuclear, no?
20-kiloton sounds nuclear to me) Tarkovsky presents us with a perfectly framed
shot of the three. The camera pulls back. The shot could be a painting. Over the
course of the next few minutes we watch the walls glow orange and gold (with a
similar palate to the non-Zone scenes), then fade to a dark deep purplish gray
before darkening to black, then a Tarkovskian rain starts up, lasts a few
minutes, then dies off. It is simultaenously conscious—Tarkovsky didn’t shoot
that lengthy shot by accident—and entirely unconscious—I don’t think even
Tarkovsky knew what it meant. There are numerous parts to this film that feel
that way.

Parts are allegorical, parts are symbolic, parts are strictly mythological. The
film has no clear meaning, though I think it deals deeply with faith, society,
imprisonment, and escape. Stalker was recently _released_ from prison, but seems
to constantly _feel_ imprisoned. The Zone is the only place where Stalker seems
to feel free (he says as much). This was Tarkovsky’s last film before fleeing
the Soviet Union, and it has been commented that the film seems to present a
dire wish to escape the Soviet Union (the scene whereby the three are evade the
authorities to escape into the Zone seems exactly such a wish-fulfillment
dream). This is also the film that _quite literally_ killed Tarkovsky.

Shot in and around an abandoned nuclear power station in Talinn, Estonia, there
is such an incredible amount of pollution in this film it’s no wonder Tarkovsky
died of cancer at 56. I had to look up the film production techniques to
understand where Tarkovsky found the money to shoot such destroyed, dystopian,
apocalyptically polluted environments. It wasn’t a set. This place was real. And
it certainly doesn’t make one eager to live in the Soviet Union. Most reviews of
this film comment on how gorgeous this film is. People have strange definitions
of “gorgeous” when it comes to film. It is a profoundly _ugly_ film. The
cinematography is amazing, but I find it hard to call it beautiful. It is
perhaps like the contradictory definitions we have for tragedies. They are sad
tales. But they are also beautiful tales. It is definitely one of the
complexities of humanity and art that we can say something ugly artistically
represented is beautiful. Because it is impossible for me to say this film
_isn’t_ beautiful, despite the incredible ugliness the film captures.

As well, there are some incredibly strange and prototypically Tarksovskian shots
that, well, frankly annoyed me. I refer specifically to the interminable panning
close up show Tarkovsky made of the random odds and ends of abandoned trash in
the water in the resting scene before Stalker recites the prayer. It is an
incredibly odd shot. It is in the golden sepia of the non-Zone. And it is
shocking when it begins. But it goes on for so long it felt painful. I felt I
understood it. Then it kept going on. Suddenly I _didn’t_ feel like I understood
it. Then the shot ends on Stalker’s head.

It doesn’t actually make sense now that I rewatch this particular scene. The
Stalker seems to be dreaming about outside-the-Zone. The shot cuts back and
forth between present-Stalker and either past or future not-in-Zone Stalker (the
dog he brings home from the Zone is in one of the shots—point one for
future-Stalker). Then finally we end up on Stalker’s head in sepia. the shot
pans north above the Stalker. Stops on a little island with a snail. Then
continues panning up. We see:

1.  A hypodermic needle
2.  A metal serving bowl
3.  Numerous odds and ends of metal and other unidentifiable objects.
4.  Wire or plastic tubing
5.  A glass bowl containing some small fish in the water (as thought the fish
    are trapped)
6.  More needles, a medical tray, coins
7.  A Russian Orthodox icon
8.  Gauze
9.  A luger pistol
10. Tile of a design we see multiple times in the film
11. A clock-like gear system
12. Barbed wire
13. A long spring
14. What seems to be a page from a day calendar with the arabic numerals 28
15. A typewriter? I see metal brackets with some kind of round drum at the top
16. Wire
17. Some kind of large wrought-iron piston like object that initially resembles
    a skull

And we end on a hand (I was wrong about where the shot ended), the camera pulls
back, and we see the jacket of (I believe) Stalker. The shot changes to the dog
Stalker brings back. Then we see Stalker’s head.

The shot is long as hell, and I don’t _get_ it. I am certain that arrangement of
objects was not accidental (or at least mostly not). The hypodermic needles are
significant, as they’ve been shown earlier and later in the film (including in
the very beginning on Stalker’s real world night stand). The Russian orthodox
icon and the luger pistol seem hugely significant. As do the coins. But what do
they reprsent and why are they being shown? Some of them are more obvious than
others:

1. The use of drugs in a dead society
5. A representation of imprisonment
6. Coins represent greed, materialistic society
7. The icon obviously represents religiosity (which is lacking in Soviet
   society for obvious reasons)
9. Violence in a dead society

These objects seem highly evocative. But are they _meant_ to mean something?
Perhaps my initial hatred of this shot masks a love for it. It _is_ stuck in my
head, in the same way the shot after the bomb disarmament is stuck in my head.

Finally, two last comments I will make. 

One, the scene where Stalker’s wife talks directly to us, the viewer, is
extremely discomfiting. It is hard to say why.

And two, trains are highly significant in this film. They are a symbol, or
theme. They represent the boundary between the Zone and the real world, to be
certain. They also seem to represent freedom, which loomed on the horizon for
Tarkovsky.
