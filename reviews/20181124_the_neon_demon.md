## Nicolas Winding Refn’s _The Neon Demon_
=======================================

Wow. Eros and Thanatos, once again.

So I definitely understand why _this_ one is polarizing, to a greater extent
than _Only God Forgives_. Holy christ was this film unsparing. I suppose _Raw_
might end up being as brutal as this one.

But I do think that if one can forgive the excess (which is not unwarranted),
then the film is _incredibly_ trenchant.

I will not go overly into the cultural commentary of this film, because I think
it’s rather obvious on the surface level. Obviously the film is brutal about
materialism, youth obsession, and the exploitation of women and girls and the
creation of unrealistic body images and standards of beauty. That’s all pretty
obvious and surface level (ironic that some of the deepest levels of other
films, all the things I just enumerated, are _surface_ level for Refn).

What I will say is that Refn is one of the most Jungian and Freudian directors
I’ve ever encountered. He is _obsessed_ with psychological archetype. A few
notes on this:

- There is a preponderance of triangles. Clear, abstracted, geometric symbol. I
  have read that triangles represent sexuality; I cannot confirm that, though I
  can say an upside down circle, which recurs in this film, in triplicate, in an
  almost Pythagorean way, certainly in a Jungian way, is a clear reference to
  the pubic region of a woman.
- There is a preponderance of dream imagery, like in _Only God Forgives_, which
  is not always easy to sort out, though certainly more clear than in that film.
- Swallowing a knife is a clear phallic symbol conveying exploitation.
- The mountain lion is a complex symbol, though a mountain lion in particular
  conveys a symbol of savagery-in-a-corner, since they are so endemic to
  American cities, frequently ending up causing havoc.
- Vampirism is a _massive_ motif in this film. I am sure that Refn has seen the
  studies that show that the blood of young rats revitalizes older rats.
- _Not everything makes sense in this film_. The biggest example is the “show”
  in the first party scene. It is chaotic and practically superfluous.
- Ruby’s day job as a mortician (night job?) is pretty explicitly symbolic.
- Ruby’s _necrophilia_ is _also_ pretty explicitly symbolic (Eros and Thanatos,
  baby!).
- The eyeball at the end of the film is _pretty explicitly symbolic_.
- _The parched landscape in the credit roll is_ pretty _explicitly symbolic_.
- One part of the film I can’t make much comment about is the murder of the girl
  in (presumably) room 214.
- What the heck is with Ruby gushing in the moonlight?

One thing I will note before concluding this analysis, which is short for the
seemingly obvious reason (to me) that this film is simultaneously multi-layered
and relatively straightforward about it’s symbolism, is that Jesse becomes
conceited in a way that it’s hard to not expect the reaction from the other
girls. Of course this is victim-blaming, and that might be Refn’s point, to make
us complicit in the other girls’ acts.

Alright, that’s it. I think Refn is pretty brilliant. I’ll keep my eye open for
his next projects.
