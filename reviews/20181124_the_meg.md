## Jon Turtletaub's _The Meg_
==========================

Wow. What a massive, interminable piece of shit.

Jon Turtletaub sucks so bad he doesn't even know how to make a bad movie.

He legitimately thinks his fake outs are fooling anyone.

Holy crap that was bad.

I have to watch like six Ingmar Bergman films to wash it out of my eyes.
