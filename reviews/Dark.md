# Dark

With the release of the third and final season of Dark I am ecstatic to finish
this series. Unfortunately, much of it is relatively rough in my memory, and as
I watch the first two episodes of Season 3 I felt a little lost and bored.

So! I am going to rewatch seasons 1 and 2 and write in this markdown file my
observations. This is a sufficiently complex work of art to merit a significant
amount of literary analysis, so that is what I am going to do.

Before I begin I'd just like to say a few things about my observations the first
two times I watched this series:

The cycles are 33 years. This is the Christ cycle. The life cycle, as it were.

The two time fluctuations are in the cave and the nuclear power plant. They are
connected to one another. This is because the cave represents our past, and the
nuclear power plant represents our future. They are inextricably linked.

"Sic Mundus Creatus Est" means "Thus the world was created." Viz., out of time.

The family dysfunction across generations within the eternal recurrence theme
serves to personalize the universe: we re-enact our parents foibles. We commit
the same sins visited upon us.

Okay! Now to begin!
