With the release of the third and final season of Dark I am ecstatic to finish
this series. Unfortunately, much of it is relatively rough in my memory, and as
I watch the first two episodes of Season 3 I felt a little lost and bored.

So! I am going to rewatch seasons 1 and 2 and write in this markdown file my
observations. This is a sufficiently complex work of art to merit a significant
amount of literary analysis, so that is what I am going to do.

Before I begin I'd just like to say a few things about my observations the first
two times I watched this series:

The cycles are 33 years. This is the Christ cycle. The life cycle, as it were.

The two time fluctuations are in the cave and the nuclear power plant. They are
connected to one another. This is because the cave represents our past, and the
nuclear power plant represents our future. They are inextricably linked.

"Sic Mundus Creatus Est" means "Thus the world was created." Viz., out of time.

The family dysfunction across generations within the eternal recurrence theme
serves to personalize the universe: we re-enact our parents foibles. We commit
the same sins visited upon us.

Okay! Now to begin!

## Season 1
### Episode 1

Ah, the letter is to be opened on my birthday. Inter√©ssant.

Yes, I know it is a German television show, I will still be using French words.

The intro is still one of th emost lovely and fascinating pieces of video art.
The reflections produce some wild shapes and effects.

I feel like that yellow jacket is symbolic but I have no idea how. It is so
iconic to the series, they even sell it online.

Probably insignificant, but the Mikkel's caretaker keeps his letter in a box
with a tree on it. IIRC there's a tree on the door to the passageway. The world
tree seems likely. Yggdrasil?

The thing perhaps most intriguing to me about the nuclear power plant is that
Germany is currently in the process of phasing out all nuclear power. I think
they are retarded for that, and it's caused them to rely more heavily on coal,
but it's a fact and the writers are aware of it, which makes the power plant =
future equation more shaky and weird. In the series the plant is being shut
down. Why is the future being taken off line?

Obviously all of Mikkel's magic and Houdini obsession is just resonance with the
deeper theme material. It's the sort of detail that lesser writers miss. They
don't see that every bit of a story should feed thematically into the whole.

I don't remember the first time I saw this hearing how many English words the
Germans use. I know the French are like this too. I've heard fuck, hey, and
bullshit already.

Germans and the forest, man. I don't even know.

The burnt eyes really seems symbolic. I mean, of course, blindness has been a
symbol throughout history and literature. Oedipus is the first thing that comes
to mind.

Old Jonas is really very menacing in the early part of the series. I don't
remember why he was experimenting on the Oberdorf (or whatever) boy.
