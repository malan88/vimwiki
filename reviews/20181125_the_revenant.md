## Alejandro González Iñárritu’s _The Revenant_
============================================

I don’t understand why Mexican directors are so incredibly good, but it is a
fact. I had never seen an Iñárritu film before this, but now I feel a need to
seek out even more. Cuarón is a genius; I had already known that after seeing
_Children of Men_, but learned that it wasn’t a fluke after having seen _Y Tu
Mamá También_. I was slightly disappointed in _Gravity_, but not devastatedly
so. I have yet to watch a full Guillermo del Toro film (I turned of _Shape of
Water_ for some reason; I suppose I will revisit it) but have watched his
television show _The Strain_ which was a massive shithole. I have always wanted
to see _Pan’s Labyrinth_, though.

Now, I have a number of films from Iñárritu to look for. I always wanted to see
Babel; now I have no excuse not to watch it. I was never interested in
_Birdman_, but now I am. _Amores Perros_ is now interesting to me. Or should I
say interesante? _21 Grams_. These are all films I have heard of but never
connected with a particular director.

Now, after having seen a film as incredible as _The Revenant_, I will have to
watch them all.

Me gusto Nuevo Cine Mexicano. Yo quiero ir a Ciudad de México ahora.

This film, like Cuarón’s, is rife with realism, uses documentary-style
cinematography coupled with incredibly gorgeous vistas and framing, and employs
subtle symbolism at key moments:

- A bird crawling out of a dying woman’s shirt and taking flight to convey the
  leaving of the soul
- A spiral engraved on a canteen while a story of a scalping and the genesis of
  a man’s racism to convey the cycle of violence, the eternal recurrence of
  xenophobia and racism
- A man’s naked rebirth from the stomach of a dead horse during a snowstorm

It is always fascinating when a filmmaker decides to include lens flares. It
draws attention to the camera. Iñárritu uses a highly documentary-style camera
movement, walking around the characters with the camera in a steadycam and
making the scene feel like a real world drama we’re witnessing. Sometimes it can
feel almost like a stage play with a camera on stage (the scene after the fur
trappers get off of their boat, when Fitzgerald confronts Glass with his
accusations). The opening massacre has been compared to the Normandy Beach
sequence in Saving Private Ryan, which comparison I understand, but I was most
reminded of Cuarón’s two lengthy one-take action sequences in _Children of Men_.

I don’t feel the necessity to go into a deep analysis with this film. I write
these for my own benefit, to digest the meaning of the films that I might have
the most to think about. I don’t have very much to think about in this film.

Good day, sir.
