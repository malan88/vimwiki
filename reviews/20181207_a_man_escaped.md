## Robert Bresson’s _Un condamné à mort s’est échappé ou Le vent souffle où il veut_
=================================================================================

Wow. I understand Bresson now.

This is older than _Au Hasard Balthazar_, and so is not quite as Bressonian, if
I might say so (that is to say, it actually has moments of emotional expression,
namely a scene where Fontaine sobs into his pillow; though it does not show his
face with emotion), but c’est incroyable.

First of all, while some things I have read have made the film out to be
allegorically Christian, representing deliverance and freedom from sin, I really
read it as almost Sartran, an investigation into freedom, how to attain it, how
to live with it, the duties we have to attain it—which may not perhaps be
Sartran, as we are _condemned_ to freedom in Sartre. Perhaps an allegory for
accepting ones freedom? Anyway, the prison motif read as extraordinarily Sartran
to me, the time period is perfect for it, the actual subject, an escape from
prison, is incredibly indicative of existentialism, and even Sartre’s own
trilogy of novels, titled _The Road to Freedom_, deals with WWII.

So there’s all that.

I have been considerably less locquacious with my pen lately. I am not currently
in the mood to discuss this more. I should have discussed it days ago (I keep
writing these reviews far too late to have it still fresh in my mind).
