Today I bring a double feature review (followed by a third review from
yesterday).

## David Mackenzie’s _Hell or High Water_

I hate Texas. I hate the South as well. They are regions that hold nothing but
backwards thinking and such incredibly heavy historical moral baggage that we
may as well write the regions off as sinkholes.

But there is nothing I love more than the Southern Literature. And I can say the
same thing about Texan literature (though I don't want to live in Texas, while I
like living in the South): they're both regions that perfectly convey the
meaning of the Human Experience in their history, culture, and experience.

_Hell or High Water_ is a film that captures a certain type of Great American
Story that I’ve always had high regard for. Let me discurse for a moment and
tell you, dear reader, about it (because Lord knows the Wikipedia on Great
American Novel is a stub; I should probably try improving it).

There are two types of Great American Novels. We’re going to immediately
dispense with the term Great American Novel in favor of the term Great American
Story, because this genre transcends medium.

The first type of Great American Story is the Type Drama. That is to say, it has
a significantly sized cast that represents the American Types: The Huckster, The
“Aw Shucks,” The Leader, The Marylin, The Jackie O, etc., etc. A great example
of a Great American Story of this form (which does not perfectly hew to the
American Typology, but follows the form), is Apocalypse Now. Another example, in
literature, would be The Grapes of Wrath. Still another, and a masterpiece that
puts the other two masterpieces to shame, would be Moby Dick.

I am a fan of Great American Story’s in all their myriad forms. Moby Dick is one
of my favorite novels. I have read it three times. The Grapes of Wrath ranks up
there as well.  I don’t know how many times I have copied out by hand the
passage that ends

> This you may say of man - when theories change and crash, when schools,
> philosophies, when narrow dark alleys of thought, national, religious,
> economic, grow and disintegrate, man reaches, stumbles forward, painfully,
> mistakenly sometimes. Having stepped forward, he may slip back, but only half
> a step, never the full step back.

more times than I can count. And Apocalypse Now has been one of my favorite
films many, many years.

But my heart has always been with the *second* form of Great American Story.

Now this kind of Great American Story is about a single character. It isn’t told
by a single character, it doesn’t focus solely on a single character, but it is
about a single character. That character is The American Soul. I will be using
male pronouns in describing the American Soul, so take no offense. For The
American Soul is not gendered. Though you may wish he were, if you were female.

The American Soul is prominently featured in many Great American Story’s, and he
was most accurately described by a Brit, D.H. Lawrence:

> The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer. It has
> never yet melted.

That single statement sums up nearly the entirety of the body of literature (and
film) that would be classified as a Great American Story of the second form.

These Great American Stories nearly always feature Americans trying to make it.
That is, to achieve the American Dream. The American Dream, as it is typically
portrayed, is simple Material Prosperity. We could unpack it, but we won’t,
because both you and I know there is more to Material Prosperity than the term
Material Prosperity conveys. It’s hope for one’s future, one’s children’s
futures, and their children’s. The American Dream is most accurately conveyed by
*another* quote, from John Adams (which I hadn’t, until now, realized was a real
quote):

> I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study
> mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy,
> geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and
> agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting,
> poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.

The American Dream is not about oneself, but about what is most important to
oneself: one’s family, one’s descendants.

I’m unpacking Material Prosperity, which I said I wouldn't do, but that is what
the American Dream *is*.

As such, what is most fascinating about these Great American Story’s is their
honesty. Americans love to pretend they are honest hard-working folk, but
America is so full of stories about hucksters lying and cheating to get ahead
(and succeeding) that we cannot ignore this particular facet of the American
Soul. We love a scallawag. Anyone who has ever watched _Gone With The Wind_,
another story of Great American Story dimensions, knows that we like Scarlett
and Rhett far more than we like Melanie and Ashley.  We think they’re better
people than Scarlett and Rhett, but Scarlett and Rhett are more American than
the entire Supreme Court put together. America is about up and comers. We love
self-made men, we love clever-as-a-fox rascals, and we love a good bank robbery.

Which brings me to the most fascinating aspect of a Great American Story's of
this form, to why I love the South, and why Cormac McCarthy writes the most
American novels:

Underneath the huckster image of the pursuit of the American Dream is the
killer. Something we’re much less likely to acknowledge, but our literature
feels it's got the right to. More blood has been spilled on American Land in the
name of money than in the name of any religion. While the forests of Europe are
stained red with the blood of Catholics, Huguenots, and Non-Conformists, the
bluegrass of America is so red with greed we’ll never wash it out. And the South
and the West in general, Texas in particular, and Great American Story’s like
Faulkner’s _Absalom, Absalom!_, Philipp Meyer’s _The Son_, and Peter
Matthiessen’s _Shadow Country_ are more honest expressions of the American Soul
than any WASPy New England story can ever hope to be. Greed is the foundational
vice. It is why we took the Indians' land. And greedy is the cause of slavery,
America's original sin.

Which brings us to _Hell or High Water_. This film is a Great American Story of
the second type. It is about an honest, smart, and kind man, Toby, with a
trouble-making older brother just out of prison, who just wants to secure the
family farm for his children’s Material Prosperity. Any way he can.

Stories like this are what America is built on. We can lean back and judge the
main character for being involved in the bank robberies, which, as Jeff Bridges
rightly points out at the end, is *exactly* what caused four people, including
his partner to die. He’s right. As far as it goes, those four people died so
that Toby's children could prosper. He took at least one whole family’s father,
and probably another's, just so his children could live well. Jeff Bridges is
right in his condemnation.

But lets think back to the middle of the film. Jeff Bridges and his partner
Alberto are sitting outside of a Texas Midlands Bank, and Alberto part Native
American, gives a speech.

> Alberto: People lived in caves for 150,000 years but they don’t do it no more.
>
> Marcus (Jeff Bridges): Eh, maybe your people did.
>
> Alberto: Your people did too. A long time ago your ancestors were the Indians.
> Until someone came along and killed ’em, and made you into one of
> them. 150 years ago, all this was my ancestor’s land. Everything you could
> see. Everything you saw yesterday. ’Til the grandparents of these folks took
> it, and now it’s been taken from them. ’Cept it ain’t no army doing it, it’s
> those sons of bitches right there.

He’s pointing, as he says it, at a bank. In the scheme of the movie, this is
about the financial crash, and how we never really recovered from it. In the
scheme of a Great American Story, we can begin to see what the reality of the
movie is, even if the author wasn’t: the American Soul, which is hard, isolate,
stoic, and a killer. Even further, it’s about the Cycle of American Violence,
which really is, and always has been, the Cycle of Human Violence. The reality
of America, of The American Soul is that it’s just a concentration of the Stuff
of All Humans.

I read an article many years ago, I thought in a Time magazine, but I have no
idea how to find it, about how there is, in fact, a genetic basis to American
identity: a particular allele of DRD2 which codes for risk-taking behavior. It
is found in higher concentrations among Americans. But even factoring out the
genetic basis, we can already see how this would work: risk-takers self-select
for long dangerous journeys. Therefore, from the earliest Americans crossing a
land bridge over the Bering Sea, to German migrants in Texas, to illegal
immigrants from Central America, we, as Americans, are a self-selected bunch of
risk-taking dreamers and schemers.

This is why America has always represented the future. Why it has been the most
innovative, fast-moving, forward-looking country in the world. It is why America
represents the promised land. And it’s why, soaked into our soil, is the blood
of countless victims of the hard, isolate, stoic American Soul. It is also why,
at least in the case of Texas and the West, there is a particular concentration
of this soul.

So can we really judge Toby? To quote a [2015 Harper’s Magazine article on the
Cliven Bundy standoff][0]:

> In 1885, William A. J. Sparks, the commissioner of the General Land Office,
> reported to Congress that “unscrupulous speculation” had resulted in “the
> worst forms of land monopoly . . . throughout regions dominated by
> cattle-raising interests.” West of the hundredth meridian, cattle barons had
> enclosed the best forage along with scarce supplies of water in an arid
> landscape. They falsified titles using the signatures of cowhands and family
> members, employed fictitious identities to stake claims, and faked
> improvements on the land to appear to comply with the law. “Probably most
> private range land in the western states,” a historian of the industry
> concluded, “was originally obtained by various degrees of fraud.”

If we read Philipp Meyer’s _The Son_, we can see exactly this dynamic:
generation after generation kills, steals, and murders to obtain what they have.
Similar things have always happened back east as well, though: Malcolm Gladwell
[writes in The New Yorker][1]:

> Six decades ago, Robert K. Merton argued that there was a series of ways in
> which Americans responded to the extraordinary cultural emphasis that their
> society placed on getting ahead. The most common was “conformity”: accept the
> social goal (the American dream) and also accept the means by which it should
> be pursued (work hard and obey the law). The second strategy was “ritualism”:
> accept the means (work hard and obey the law) but reject the goal. That’s the
> approach of the Quakers or the Amish or of any other religious group that
> substitutes its own moral agenda for that of the broader society. There was
> also “retreatism” and “rebellion”—rejecting both the goal and the means. It
> was the fourth adaptation, however, that Merton found most interesting:
> “innovation.” Many Americans—particularly those at the bottom of the
> heap—believed passionately in the promise of the American dream. They didn’t
> want to bury themselves in ritualism or retreatism. But they couldn’t conform:
> the kinds of institutions that would reward hard work and promote advancement
> were closed to them. So what did they do? They innovated: they found
> alternative ways of pursuing the American dream. They climbed the crooked
> ladder.

> All three of the great waves of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century
> European immigrants to America innovated. Irish gangsters dominated organized
> crime in the urban Northeast in the mid to late nineteenth century, followed
> by the Jewish gangsters—Meyer Lansky, Arnold Rothstein, and Dutch Schultz,
> among others. Then it was the Italians’ turn. They were among the poorest and
> the least skilled of the immigrants of that era. Crime was one of the few
> options available for advancement. The point of the crooked-ladder argument
> and “A Family Business” was that criminal activity, under those circumstances,
> was not rebellion; it wasn’t a rejection of legitimate society. It was an
> attempt to join in.

We can see *exactly* this in the absolutely jaw-droppingly brilliant opening
line of _The Godfather_:

> I believe in America.

So what is this? What does it mean? I should think that would be obvious: the
very thing that makes America incredible, that makes America the future, is the
same thing that causes Americans to still pay too much for bad medical care, to
still not have a decent welfare safety net, and to still be stuck with a gun
problem that makes it stand out as the only first world nation in the world with
a gun-death rate that matches third-world countries. It's not because we're
ignorant, it's because we're risk-taking dreamers and schemers, pushy little
fuckers that would just as soon rob you as be your friend. Americans, as a
*people* have a problem with authority.

And it’s exactly why films like _Hell or High Water_ are incredibly brilliant.
It is *not* a moralizing film. It does *not* cast judgement on any side in the
drama.

Robert Nozick, in the introduction to his book _The Examined Life_, which I,
frustratingly cannot seem to locate in my library just now, talks about why
painted portraits are better than pictures: because over so many sittings, under
so many lightings, in so many different moods, the painter aggregates the soul
of the painted into one image. He says books about life can be like that too: if
we take The Nicomachean Ethics, for instance, or, even better, Montaigne’s
Essays, they aren’t strictly straightforward arguments for a particular thesis,
but portraits of what it’s like to live. Musings, we might call them.

Good literature is precisely like that. A really great GAS2 is *strictly* that.
In _Absalom, Absalom!_ we muse on the fates and fortunes of one man, Thomas
Sutpen, in h is relentless pursuit of the American Dream. In _The Son_ we muse
on the way that the cycle of violence repeats itself, and on how all American
gotten gains are gotten through ill. In _No Country For Old Men_ we reflect on
the way violence perpetuates itself into seemingly new forms, or how, rather,
we’re constantly shocked by violence, forgetting that it has existed since time
immemorial. And here, in _Hell or High Water_, what we see is a musing on how
these same cyclical patterns are repeating themselves even now, even today,
after the Great Recession.

Ultimately, *every single one of us* is benefiting from someone else's
suffering. Every single one of us has ancestors that killed to survive, that
killed to preserve their bloodline. We all come from villains. So is Toby a bad
guy? Was The Colonel in The Son? Or Thomas Sutpen? What difference is there
between his children and ours? Time. That is all. Generations. That is all.
Moral judgement in this case is merely a question of degree.

So when you watch _Hell or High Water_, judge Chris Pine's character if you
like. Because you're judging yourself.
