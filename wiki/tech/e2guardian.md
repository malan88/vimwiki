Holy cow does this program's documentation suck.

install squid and e2guardian. Make sure proxyport is set to the same as squid's
port (3128). I don't actually know if this step is necessary, but it works now,
so maybe try without it and see.

You boot up both programs. Then you connect to e2guardian's port, 8080. You
won't be able to see https blocked, it just won't load. Who cares.
