# Syrups

## Demerara Gum Syrup (Death & Co. from Cocktail Codex)
This syrup has completely changed the way I view syrups. I use it liberally,
with anything that calls for Demerara syrup.

> Demerara sugar has large, dark granules. The dark color scomes from the
> molasses naturally present within the sugar, which confers a rich toffee
> flavor. In cocktails, we often use Demerara Gum Syrup to round off the edges
> of intense spirits, as in the Old-Fashioneds, or to add richness. However,
> because of the demerara's molasses-y flavor, there are also limits to its use.
> If we're seeking a clean or sharp flavor in a cocktail, we typically don't use
> this syrup, as it could muddy the drink. In addition, the qualities that round
> the edges of fiery spirits can make it unsuitable for other applications; for
> example, we probably wouldn't use it in a Daiquiri, where it may dull the
> fresh, bright flavors we're looking for. In stirred cocktails, like the
> Old-Fashioned, a gum syrup allows us to add more body to a cocktail without
> making it too sweet.

- 300g (10 oz.) demerara sugar ()
- 150g (5 oz.) filtered water
- 18g (0.6 oz.) gum arabic

Set up a sous-vide at 145Â°F.

Combine the demerara and gum arabic in a blender, and run it for about 30
seconds. As it is still running, slowly add the water. Blend for another 2
minutes, until everything seems incorporated. You may have to run a spoon on the
inside to get some gum arabic off the walls and into the blender.

Transfer the contents into a bag and cook in the sous-vide as you would anything
for 2 hours.

Throw it in an ice bath and transfer to a bottle. Per Cocktail Codex, keep
refrigerated up to 2 weeks. That sounds silly to me.
