## Piña Colada Clarified Milk Punch 
### Makes about 4 servings
[From Cocktail Chemistry](https://youtu.be/ZSBzzPvLk6c)

- 8oz (240ml) aged rum
- 4.5oz (135ml) coconut water
- 2oz (60ml) Allspice Dram
- 0.5oz (15ml) simple syrup
- 3oz (90ml) fresh pineapple juice, strained
- 2oz (60ml) fresh lime juice, strained
- 5oz (150ml) cold whole milk

1. Add milk to a large glass bowl and set aside
2. Mix remaining ingredients into a pitcher
3. Slowly pour punch mixture into the milk and gently stir until it curdles
4. Let it separate in the fridge, hopefully for a few hours. Don't have an exact
   time
5. Use a cheese cloth to get an initial strain.
6. Use a v60 to strain through.
7. Pour some through, capture with a bowl, and pour the initial back through. An
   initial layer of curds helps with the straining, so you want to capture the
   initial few ounces to refilter through their own curds.
8. This takes forever. Best strategy: pour a ton in, up close to the top of the
   V60. It goes faster when the V60 is fuller because of pressure. So keep it
   topped while you still have some. Resist the urge to squeeze the filter, you
   will pop it and recontaminate the filtered stuff.
9. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator indefinitely
10. Serve in a chilled rocks glass over ice
