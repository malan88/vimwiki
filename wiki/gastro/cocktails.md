# Michael's Cocktail Wiki
The resources are pretty essential to making some of the drinks.

My preferred variants will be bolded.

I almost never use London Dry gin, but I have an excessive gin collection for a
beginning mixologist. I've been using a lot of Botanist and Glendalough,
recently more Green House gin. I try to get a taste of the flavor profile and
then guess a good flavor profile for the recipe.

N.B. One barspoon is 1/8 oz. One teaspoon is 1/6 oz.

## Cocktail portals
Cocktail Codex breaks down all cocktails into 6 base cocktails everything else
is a riff on. I'm going to follow a similar strategy here. Each link below
consists of (a) the best rendition I've found of the base cocktail, and a lot of
variations.

Some of these will be stubs. I created them initially as a framework to which I
can keep adding on.

[Old Fashioned](old_fashioned.md): Spirit forward with a sweetener and bitters.

[Martini](martini.md): Balance between spririt and aromatized wine.

[Negroni](negroni.md): Equal parts cocktails (or close), and their variants.

[Daiquiri](daiquiri.md): Spirit, citrus, and sweetener.

[Sidecar](sidecar.md): Mostly spirit and liqueur.

[Whiskey Highball](highball.md): A cocktail topped with a nonalcoholic mixer
(e.g. tonic).

[Flip](flip.md): Spirit or fortified wine and a rich ingredient.

[Tiki](tiki.md): Basically punch.
