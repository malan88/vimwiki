# Michael's Cocktail Wiki
The resources are pretty essential to making some of the drinks.

My preferred variants will be bolded.

I almost never use London Dry gin, but I have an excessive gin collection for a
beginning mixologist. I've been using a lot of Botanist and Glendalough,
recently more Green House gin. I try to get a taste of the flavor profile and
then guess a good flavor profile for the recipe.

N.B. One barspoon is 1/8 oz. One teaspoon is 1/6 oz.

## Cocktail portals
Cocktail Codex breaks down all cocktails into 6 base cocktails everything else
is a riff on. I'm going to follow a similar strategy here. Each link below
consists of the best rendition I've found of the base cocktail and a lot of
variations.

Occasionally a variation from Cocktail Codex in particular don't fit with the
original recipe enough to fit in the true template. An example is their Poet's
Dream, which is a Negroni variation. The CC Poet's Dream is a Martini.

Some of these will be stubs. I created them initially as a framework to which I
can keep adding on.

[Old Fashioned](old_fashioned.md): Spirit forward with a sweetener and bitters.

[Martini](martini.md): Balance between spririt and aromatized wine.

[Negroni](negroni.md): Equal parts cocktails (or close), and their variants.

[Daiquiri](daiquiri.md): Spirit, citrus, and sweetener.

[Sidecar](sidecar.md): Mostly spirit and liqueur.

[Whiskey Highball](highball.md): A cocktail topped with a nonalcoholic mixer
(e.g. tonic).

[Flip](flip.md): Spirit or fortified wine and a rich ingredient.

[Tiki](tiki.md): Basically punch.

## Cocktails to try

### Fade to Black

- 5 Blackberries
- 2 oz Spiced rum

Muddle blackberries, reverse dry shake, double strain up in a coupe.

I want to try subbing a charcoal solution or simple syrup. I do not know the
proportions so I'll just try adding a barspoon of charcoal at a time to water
until it looks good. It tastes like garbage otherwise.

### Toby's Lime Cordial
Strip the zest from 12 limes, reserving the zest, then juice the limes. Weigh
the lime juice and measure an equal amount of sugar (by weight). In a
nonreactive container, combine the lime juice and sugar and stir until the sugar
is dissolved. Stir in the lime zest and taste; the mixture should be slightly
more tart than sweet and fairly viscous. Adjust the flavor and texture as needed
with more lime juice or sugar. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 24
hours, stirring occasionally. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Store in the
refrigerator for up to 1 month.
