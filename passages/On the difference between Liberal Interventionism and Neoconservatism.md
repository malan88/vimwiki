# On the difference between Liberal Interventionism and Neoconservatism

> Progressive internationalists recognize that U.S. foreign policy is
> now a holistic enterprise that must first summon all sources of
> national power to deal with what goes on within states as well as
> between them — direct and multilateral diplomacy, development aid to
> build infrastructure and civil society, trade to promote growth,
> intelligence collection, and law enforcement, to name a few — and only
> then turn to force as the final guarantor of peace and stability.

> Neocons, however, disdain multilateral diplomacy and overestimate the
> efficacy of military force. Their lopsided preoccupation with "hard
> power" creates an imposing facade of strength, but in fact saps the
> economic, political, and moral sources of American influence. By
> overspending on the military and allowing the other levers of American
> power to atrophy, neocons misallocate precious U.S. national resources
> in two ways — leaving the United States with too little of the "smart
> power" capacities desperately needed in war zones like Afghanistan and
> an overabundance of "hard power" capacities it will never use. The
> trick is to carefully cultivate both, as Defense Secretary Robert
> Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Chairman of the Joint
> Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen have championed since Obama took
> power.

> Progressive internationalists believe the United States should be the
> unquestioned vanguard of democratic values, and that American
> leadership is strengthened when granted a sense of legitimacy that
> attracts others to our cause. Without a doubt, unilateral application
> of force in self-defense is a legitimate exercise of power, but
> legitimacy can evaporate under two circumstances: when America’s
> actions betray its core values or when America acts offensively
> without an international mandate and the backing of close allies. My
> organization, the Progressive Policy Institute, in a 2003 manifesto on
> progressive internationalism, argued that "the way to keep America
> safe and strong is not to impose our will on others or pursue a
> narrow, selfish nationalism that betrays our best values, but to lead
> the world toward political and economic freedom."

> Neocons, by contrast, pursue security interests at the expense of
> American values and damage U.S. legitimacy while doing so. That was
> George W. Bush: He betrayed American values and alienated core
> international partners by torturing prisoners, denying them any sense
> of due process, and falsifying a threat to justify an effectively
> unilateral invasion of a Muslim country. He strove for the mere
> appearance of legitimacy, forging ham-fisted, bribed coalitions of the
> somewhat willing.
