== On the threat of the GOP to American Democracy ==

    The capacity of our political elites to be shocked anew by the Republican
    Party has been more shocking than anything Republicans have stooped to doing
    in the Trump era. It should be no surprise that a party willing to deny the
    reality of a climate crisis that imperils all civilization has given the
    presidency to a man who denied his black predecessor is an American. It is
    entirely logical that a party currently dismantling the right to vote has
    turned itself over to a man willing to undermine faith in the democratic
    process. Despite what the Democratic Party’s chosen rationale for
    impeachment has implied, the gravest offenses President Trump has committed
    against our country can be found not in the White House’s call logs but in
    the detention centers where the president has caged the children of migrant
    parents—children abused and traumatized in the service of a racist mythology
    Trump has crafted about the impact of immigration.  The Republican Party has
    helped him promulgate it and stands ready to help him do worse, because
    Donald Trump, beyond holding office as a Republican president, embodies the
    very soul of the Republican Party.
