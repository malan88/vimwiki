== Gatsby Notes ==

* Instead of googling au hasard, if you need to get the current path of the
  component, file, etc., simply import

    {{{
    import { globalHistory  } from "@reach/router"
    }}}

  at the top of the page, and then use globalHistory.location.pathname to get
  the name. Christ is that harder than I wanted.
