# Comprehensive list of V60 pourover methods

- [Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/pour-over)
    - 4 Pours in total
    - 15 second 60 gram bloom pour, 45 second full bloom
    - Outward spiral and reversed, 90 grams, wait 'til near drain
    - 100 grams, same pattern, 15-20 seconds
    - 100 grams, 20 seconds
    - Total 4 pours: 60g, 90g, 100g, 100g

    - Two pour phases: 40% and then 60% of total poured volume. For 350g, that's
      140g, and 210.
    - 1st pour phase divided into two pours: bloom and first pour. There's a lot
      of broscience bullshit here. Basically the idea is that the less on the
      bloom and more on the pour means  sweeter cup.
    - 2nd pour phase is equally divided into 3 pours.
    - Example: 50g, 90g, 70g, 70g, 70g. Each pour is supposed to get 45 seconds,
      but that's a long pourover: 3:45, where I like it 3-3:30.
    - Total 5 pours: 50g, 90g, 70g, 70g, 70g

    - 2g/g of coffee bloom (i.e., 2x weight): 50g for my 25g:350g ratio
    - swirl the bloom a bit, no lumps: 45ish seconds at max
    - 60% of total liquid (210g) in the next 30 seconds after bloom (by 1:15)
    - 100% of total weight in the next 30 seconds (90g)
    - Stir with a spoon clockwise and then counterclockwise, scrape sides, don't
      create a swirl because that creates a dome
    - Hotter water goes faster, go as hot as possible (100Â°!)
    - Swirl at the end during the draw down.
    - Total 3 pours: 50g, 160g, 140g
