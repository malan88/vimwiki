For future reference:

* The employee copy is printed on perforated paper with 3 tickets: this way the
  employee gets 3 copies of his w2. These are copies B, 2, and C
    * You could print it on a paper with 4 tickets: copies B, 2, 2, and C
    * The employee filing instructions should already be printed on the back of
      the form.
* The W-3, which is filed electronically
* The employer copy that gets sent to the SSA (which we do not print because
  filed electronically) is a perforated paper with 2 tickets, upon which 2
  employees get printed. This is called Copy A
* The employer copy that gets saved for our records is identical to the employer
  copy that gets sent to the IRS. This is called Copy D. There is no reason to
  print it out because we save it as a pdf.
